<A NAME="intro"><H2>Introduction and history</H2></A>
The Mongo Oligo Mass Calculator is a tool for calculating masses of oligonucleotides and fragments
obtained by collision induced dissociation (CID) or enzymatic digests.<BR>
Mongo Oligo was a program, originally written in Fortran on a MAC by Pat Limbach,
Steven Pomerantz and Jef Rozenski. The current version is rewritten for JavaScript 1.1.
In order to let all the functions of this program work, you need to enable JavaScript in the
settings of your web browser.<BR>
The current version includes mass calculation of oligonucleotides, CID fragments, endo- and exonuclease digestion.
It contains extra output options and utilities for handling the input sequence and user residue assignment. Also, an extensive help is provided.

<H2><A NAME="seq">Sequence</A></H2>
A sequence should be entered in the input window starting from 5' end down to the 3' end of the
oligonucleotide.<BR>
Modified residues can be entered using one letter codes as defined in the tRNA database [<A HREF="#refs">1</A>].<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>DNA2RNA</B><BR>
Use this button to convert the sequence from DNA to the complementary RNA counterpart. Modified residues are ignored.
<LI><B>RNA2DNA</B><BR>
Use this button to convert the sequence from RNA to the complementary DNA counterpart. Modified residues are ignored.
<LI><B>Cleanup</B><BR>
Allows the user to remove all characters from the sequence that are not A, C, G, T, or U.
<LI><B>Clear Sequence</B><BR>
Removes the sequence in the input window.

<H2><A NAME="cal">Calculation</A></H2>
<UL><LI><B>Molecular mass</B><BR>
This option calculates the mass for an entered sequence. Depending on the setting of the
monoisotopic/average mass option, the corresponding mass values will be used.
Check the selections of the 3' and 5' terminal ends and oligonucleotide type (DNA or RNA).<BR>
<LI><A NAME="ES"><B>Electrospray series</B></A><BR>
Electrospray ionization generates multiple charge states of oligonucleotides. This calculation
will give the <I>m/z</I> values for the sequence entered together with the sodium and potassium
cation adducts, commonly present in oligonucleotide spectra.<BR>
<LI><A NAME="CID"><B>CID fragments</B></A><BR>
When oligonucleotides fragment in a collision cell of a mass spectrometer,
mainly 2 types of ions are generated (see [<A HREF="#refs">2</A>]). The cleavage of a 3'C - 3'O bond yields a fragment with
the 3' oligonucleotide end that contains a phosphate at the 5' end and is called the <I>w ion</I>.
When a heterocyclic base is lost with the cleavage of the 3'C -3'O bond, the part containing
the 5' end of the oligonucleotide is called the <I>a-B ion</I>. If the 'extended output' option is checked,
additional fragment ion types will be calculated. For the complete nomenclature see ref. [<A HREF="#01">1</A>].<BR>
<LI><A NAME="IF"><B>Internal fragments</B></A><BR>
These are fragments resulting from a double backbone cleavage. They have a phosphate at their 5' end and
a furan at the 3' terminal. The calculations are limited to the maximum charge state of (+ or -) 5 or
(+ or -) 1 for non-sorted and sorted output respectively.<BR>
<LI><A NAME="BL"><B>Base losses</B></A><BR>
The intact oligonucleotide can loose a base anion (B<SUP>-</SUP>) or a neutral base (B+H). The anions are more
likely to be lost from highly charged oligonucleotides due to electrostatic repulsion.<BR>
<LI><A NAME="T1"><B>RNase T1 digest</B></A><BR>
Selection of this calulation will give all fragments obtained by T1 digestion of the oligonucleotide entered.
RNase T1 is an endonuclease that cuts RNA at the 3' end of every G in the chain, resulting in a fragment ending
on Gp or G>p depending on the reaction conditions. Both possibilities are calculated.
The mass of the fragments is also calculated. In the output window of an enzymatic digest, clicking on a partial sequence will transfer the data to the input window,
so that additional calculations for that partial sequence can be performed.<BR>
<LI><A NAME="U2"><B>RNase U2 digest</B></A><BR>
RNase U2 is an endonuclease that cuts RNA mainly at the 3' end of an A in the chain.
For this enzyme both the 3'p and 3'>p ends are calculated.<BR>
<LI><A NAME="U2"><B>RNase A digest</B></A><BR>
RNase A is an endonuclease cutting at pyrimidines. Fragments are calculated having a C or U at the 3' end.
For this enzyme also both the 3'p and 3'>p ends are calculated.<BR>
<LI><A NAME="EX"><B>5' and 3' exonuclease digest</B></A><BR>
These enzymes attack the oligo from the 5' or 3' end and release one nucleotide at the time.
The masses of the remaining oligonucleotide chain is calculated baginning with the starting sequence.
<LI><A NAME="MOD"><B>Modified RNA list</B></A><BR>
This item gives a list of all currently available modified nucleotides, their codes, the base masses and
eventually the sugar modification value. Depending on the setting of the parameter 'average/monoisotopic mass',
the corresponding masses will be shown. If the option 'sorted' is checked, the values are printed according to
the base masses. Clicking on the one-character code of the modification will transfer you to the
corresponding entry in the RNA modification database [<A HREF='#refs'>3</A>].<BR>
The one-letter codes are taken from the tRNA database [<A HREF='#refs'>1</A>].
</UL>
Some calculations are restricted to oligonucleotides not exceeding a certain length
in order to prevent memory overflow. See the table hereafter for the current specifications.<P>

<H2><A NAME="opt">Options</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI><B>average/monoisotopic mass</B><BR>
The appropriate mass selection (<B>average/monoisotopic</B>) should be selected depending on
the type of apparatus used or on the purpose of calculation. For more information see ref. [<A HRE="#02"2</A>]<BR>
<LI><B>negative/positive mode</B><BR>
Depending on the acquisition mode, positively or negatively charged ions should be considered. This can be set by this option.
It does not affect the value of the molecular mass, which is allways the mass of the neutral species.
<LI><B>DNA/RNA</B><BR>
The choice of the oligonucleotide type: deoxyribonucleotide (DNA) of ribonucleotide (RNA) determines the sugar type that will be used in the calculations.
<LI><B>allow undercut</B><BR>
If this option is checked, also undercut pieces will be calculated for enzymatic digests.

<H2><A NAME="ter">Terminals</A></H2>
Select the desired terminal on the 5' end and on the 3' end.
The most common occurences are provided.
If other groups shoul be present at the terminal ends, use <A HREF='#usr'>'user defined residue "N"'</A>.
<P>
<CENTER><A HREF="#">back to menu</A></CENTER>
<P><HR>

<H2><A NAME="mem">Memories</A></H2>
Sequences can be temporarily stored in one of the 5 available memory locations.
Use this feature before taking actions that could affect the sequence in the sequence window (e.g. cleanup, digest followed by CID calculation).
Follow these steps:
<UL>
<LI>Select a memory location (1..5).
<LI>Hit the <B>copy</B> button. The sequence (or the first part if the sequence is long) will appear in the selection window.
<LI>Perform the desired actions.
<LI>To restore a previously stored sequence, hit the <B>paste</B> button.
<LI><B>Clear all</B> will empty all memory locations.
</UL>

<CENTER><A HREF="#">back to menu</A></CENTER>
<P><HR>

<H2><A NAME="usr">User residue 'N'</A></H2>
A user defined residue, represented by the symbol 'N' in the sequence can be set up by entering
the base anion mass and the sugar modification mass. The sugar modification mass represents the mass to be added to an unmodified sugar residue
(e.g. for a 2'-<I>O</I>-Me sugar, average mass, type here the value 14.027, corresponding to an addition of CH<SUB>2</SUB>).<BR>
This feature can also be used to define a modified terminal (by setting the appropriate sugar modification mass).

<UL>
<LI><B>Close button</B><BR>
When the 'calculate' button is hit, a new window will be opened if not yet open. This output window will contain the results for the calculations.
By default, a 'close' button is provided in order to enable the user easily to close the output window. If that button is not desired (e.g. for printing purposes),
simply uncheck the 'close button' option.
<LI><B>Output summary</B><BR>
Checking this option will also output the sequence, the terminals, composition and other settings.

<LI><B>Sequence by</B><BR>
This options allows the sequence to be printed in sets of 3, 10 or 50 residues for readability.
